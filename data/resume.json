Another handles fuel tracking and route planning. We needed a custom mapping overlay on top of Apple Maps because it does not natively support RV-height routing, so I built the overlay and routing logic, with bridge and tunnel data, after a trip where I realized most bridges on the East Coast were too low for my RV."

It lets developers define an application with a set of INI files, and automation uses those files plus repo structure to build, test, and release through dev, test, acceptance, and production. That let developers focus on application code instead of delivery tooling complexity.

Before the project, we had 15 delivery teams, each coordinating with the Application and Environment Services (AES) team. Every team hosted its own delivery toolchain, and AES coordinated releases to each environment. The process was full of bottlenecks and often forced developers to request admin access to fix deployments, which led to manual changes that never made it into production. We assembled a cross-team group to stabilize the environments and built a unified delivery platform that consolidated tooling, process, and administration into a centrally managed automated pipeline. We trained developers and delegated platform access directly to teams. By limiting admin access and enabling self-service pipelines, we stabilized environments, increased deployment frequency from once per week to dozens per day, and freed 22 staff members to focus on development instead of release support."

Upgrades ran twice a year and required 5 to 10 people working three to four days around the clock. After one upgrade where I started at 7am Thursday and left Monday at 2pm, I spent the next five months automating every possible step with validation and load testing. The next upgrade finished in about 2.5 days for the core system, and the remaining application upgrades completed in 12 hours. TriZetto later asked for my scripts to use with other Blue plans."

When I asked why we rebooted them daily, I was told they would crash otherwise. After scripting reboots, I partnered with Marty Cookson to profile the environment and identify the culprit: printer drivers loaded on the Citrix servers. We replaced them with a generic Citrix driver and routed print jobs through a centralized print server, which eliminated the daily crashes."

I discovered the migration was driven solely by a Windows-only monitoring tool; the rest of the NOC stack and thousands of switches were UNIX. I paused the project, worked with the TCAM vendor in Israel to host the monitoring app on Citrix, migrated the NOC back to Solaris workstations, and then maintained the Windows/Citrix footprint required for the tool along with the Solaris desktops."
